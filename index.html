						<h2>What are low-carbon websites?</h2>
						<p>A relatively recent field of study within the world of sustainability is the effect that website design has on the environment. Modern websites are filled to the brim with tracking technology and unnecessary data that results in greater energy consumption, impacting the carbon footprints of everyone who visits them. The more processing a website requires, and the longer a device spends time browsing it, the more energy is consumed that will need to be replenished when eventually recharging the device. While this only be a negligible amount of energy on an individual basis, the cumulative effect of millions of devices browsing some of the most popular websites can have a measurable impact on the environment.</p>

						<p>Low-carbon websites aim to minimise the energy consumed across the entire process of	delivering a website to a user. Creating more efficient ways to store data, transmit data, and display it on a user’s device can change the amount of energy consumed by a device. Joanna Peel, on her Medium blog, recommends streamlining content in the website and keeping essential components while discarding unnecessary content that could add more data to the website, reducing energy consumption. Filip Bech-Larsen, CTO of Umbraco, also recommends being strategic about server placement, active hours, and regional hosting to optimising the energy required to deliver content to a user.</p>

				<h2>How does this website reduce carbon emissions?</h2>
				<p>This site is designed with the intent to have as little of a carbon footprint as possible (excluding example images under <a href="page1.html">Image Compression</a>). This is achieved in a few ways:</p>
				<div class="features">
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major">1</span>
						<h3>JavaScript</h3>
						<p>The original template for this site included JavaScript for some animations and transitions between sections. Animations look nice, but they can add unnecessary data to the website and extra processing on the device’s side. Removing JavaScript from this site reduces the size of the website and doesn't cause the device to consume as much energy.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major">2</span>
						<h3>CSS Animations</h3>
						<p>CSS animations also consume energy each time the device processes them. Removing all animation and transition-related CSS greatly reduced the file size and the energy consumed rendering them.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major">3</span>
						<h3>Display Energy</h3>
						<p>Many smartphones have OLED displays that are energy efficient, but still consume more energy when brighter pixels are being displayed. The colour palette in the website consists of darker backgrounds while remaining legible and readable, consuming less energy in the process.

						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major">4</span>
						<h3>Images</h3>
						<p>Images are stored in a small compressed JPEG file format with a limited colour palette, greatly reducing the file size while also contributing to the aesthetics of the website.
						<br><br><a href="page1.html">> Learn more about Image Compression</a>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major">5</span>
						<h3>Typefaces</h3>
						<p>The typeface “Georgia” is used throughout the website which is already preinstalled on most devices, removing the need to store large font files in the website or download fonts from third-party font providers.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major">6</span>
						<h3>Servers</h3>
						<p>Further considerations in a real application of a website accessible on the Internet would involve strategic placement of global servers and establishing content delivery networks to direct data efficiently between users across the globe, preserving energy.</p>
